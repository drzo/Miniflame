Build a Replit WebApp for Efficient Handling of GGUF LLMs with Slack Integration

Objective: Create a Replit WebApp that efficiently handles large GGUF quantized LLMs, maps their internal components (layers, attention heads, tokens) to Slack channels, and provides real-time updates on token flows, attention patterns, and model state. The WebApp should incorporate techniques for handling large models in a resource-constrained environment, leveraging memory optimization, quantization, and batch processing.

Slack API Integration:
Automatically create Slack channels representing nodes (e.g., tokens, attention heads, layers) and hyperedges (e.g., relationships between layers, token flows).
Post real-time updates on token states, attention scores, and model transformations in corresponding Slack channels.
Enable Slack bots to provide summaries and insights (e.g., token similarity, optimization suggestions).

Efficient GGUF Model Handling:
Use lazy loading and memory-mapped files to load only necessary parts of the model (layers, weights) on demand.
Implement layer-wise sharding to split the model into smaller pieces and load shards as needed.
Use batch token processing to handle long sequences efficiently and sliding windows to manage memory footprint.
Support mixed-precision inference (8-bit, 4-bit) with layer-specific quantization for optimizing performance.
Optionally allow post-quantization fine-tuning for better accuracy.

WebApp Dashboard:
Visualize the LLM hypergraph (nodes as channels, relationships as hyperedges) with interactive controls.
Track real-time token transformations, attention patterns, and weight updates across layers.
Allow users to trigger model operations (e.g., generating responses, adjusting quantization) and post results to Slack.

Optimization Techniques:
Implement pruning for underutilized attention heads or layers to reduce model size.
Introduce sparse attention and weight matrices to handle large inputs efficiently.

Hardware Optimization:
Leverage GPU or cloud-based compute if available, for faster inference and large-scale model handling.
